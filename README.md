Key Features to Implement

A weather app typically includes the following functionalities:
- Fetch real-time weather data from an API, such as OpenWeatherMap.
- Display current weather conditions, forecasts, and additional details like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Add a search feature for users to retrieve weather information for different locations.

Through this project, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with the fetch() method, promises, and handling JSON data. 
Completing a weather app strengthens your understanding of API integration, a critical skill for building dynamic web applications.
