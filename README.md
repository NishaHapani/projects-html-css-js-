Developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game is an enjoyable way to strengthen your programming logic while learning to implement basic game mechanics. 
This classic two-player game combines strategic thinking with interactive development, offering a fun yet challenging project.

Key Features to Implement:

-A Tic-Tac-Toe game typically includes:
-Build the game logic to handle player turns and determine winners.
-Create a user-friendly interface with options to reset the game.
-Add extra features, such as different board sizes or player symbols, to enhance customization.

This project introduces you to essential concepts like conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. 
It also encourages thinking about algorithms, which is crucial for more advanced projects down the line.
